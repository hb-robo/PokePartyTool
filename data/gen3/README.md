Generation 3 governs the following titles:

Pokemon: Ruby & Sapphire Versions
* Original mainline release of Generation 3.
* International release fixed some glitches, but can't find any evidence that gameplay was altered.

Pocket Monsters Colosseum
* Original release of the Genius Sonority doubles-focused spinoff game where you steal Pokemon from trainers.

Pokemon Colosseum
* Identical to Japanese release but missing e-Reader functionality, meaning Shadow Togepi, Shadow Mareep, and Shadow Scizor are inaccessible.

Pocket Monsters: FireRed & LeafGreen Versions
* Original release of the remakes of Generation 1's Red and Green.

Pokemon: FireRed and LeafGreen Versions
* Significant changes to the Trainer Tower to account for the lack of e-Reader popularity in the West, resulting in a more fleshed-out experience.
* Battles with the old woman in the Seven Island house after use of Mystery Gift was removed, along with Mystery Gift itself.

Pocket Monsters: Emerald Version
* Updated version of RS with more Pokemon, the ability to resolve both plots and catch both Groudon and Kyogre, and new content.

Pokemon: Emerald Version
* Similar to FRLG, removal of e-Reader functionality results in a different Trainer Hill, with varying matchups and rewards.

Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness
* Sequel to Colosseum, continues many of the same themes.
* Original JP release is almost entirely undocumented in the West, so will have to investigate for regional differences.
