This mode lets the player pick one of 8 teams and battle an opponent from the remaining 7.

There are four difficulties - Easy, Normal, Hard, Ultimate - each with their own pools of eight trainers. There are also Singles and Double options for each, for a total of 8 different matchups to evaluate. This data will primarily be used to determine which of the teams is best for each challenge.
